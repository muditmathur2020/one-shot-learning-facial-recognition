# Facial Verification (BioMetric) Using One-Shot Learning

![Project Logo](images/header.jpg)

## Introduction

Facial verification using biometric data has become an essential aspect of security systems, from mobile devices to advanced surveillance systems. Traditional methods often require a large amount of labeled data for training, which may not always be feasible. **One-Shot Learning** provides a solution by enabling facial verification with only a single training example. This project leverages One-Shot Learning techniques, particularly using Siamese Networks, to build an efficient and accurate facial verification system.

## Testing Method

We use "Confidence" as a parameter, ideally you should set it to higher than 95%. But depends on how linient you want to be!
